        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>If you live in a tropical country, as I do, is probably that you have access to cocoa beans. During this recipe we will go through the process of turning this into bitter chocolate.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>The cocoa beans from around 3 cacao fruits</li>
            <li>2 cups of sugar</li>
            <li>1 tbs of vanilla</li>
            <li>1 tbs of olive oil</li>
            <li>1 cup of milk</li>
            <li>2 tbs of peanut butter</li>
        </ul>
        <h2><em>Special Materials</em></h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 bag of charcoal</li>
            <li>A baking sheet</li>
            <li>A grill</li>
            <li>A chocolate mold</li>
            <li>2 sheets of wax paper</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Break the cacao fruits to extract the cocoa beans</li>
            <li>Put the cocoa beans over the wax paper sheets and let them ferment 7 days.</li>
            <li>After those days have passed, put them in the baking sheet and roast them in the grill.</li>
            <li>When they are ready, peel the skin out of every bean.</li>
            <li>Put all the materials in a blender and blend 3 times until you have a pasty consistency.</li>
            <li>Spread the result over the chocolate mold and let it freeze for around 3 hours.</li>
            <li>Take your chocolate out of the mold and there it is! A bar of chocolate made by yourself, you should be very proud.</li>
            </li>
        </ol>
